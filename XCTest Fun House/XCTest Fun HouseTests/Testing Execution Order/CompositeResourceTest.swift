/// # Testing Execution Order
///
/// ## How do you write a test that verifies execution order?
///
/// One simple and effective way is to use an `XCTestExpectation`. Let's look at relatively
/// common problem and testable solution.
///
/// Assume your app has a protocol named `Resource` containing a method to `activate` the
/// resource and a method to `deactivate` the resource.
///
/// The `Resource` protocol, for example, may be adopted by a resource referenced by the
/// currently signed in user. Often times resources must be activated and deactivated in
/// a particular order.
///
/// A `CompositeResource` can be used to help coordinate the life cycle of zero or more `Resource`s.
///
/// The goal is to test that the `CompositeResource` activates and deactivates the resources once
/// and in the correct order. The actual `CompositeResource` implementation is pretty simple. One
/// may even question the need to write a test. But what is "simple" today is complex tomorrow.
///
/// Let's see how we can test that the `Resource`s are activated and deactivated in the correct order.
/// A stub `Resource` implementation captures calls to the `activate` and `deactivate` methods. Two internally
/// created `XCTestExpection`s are used to track method invocations.
