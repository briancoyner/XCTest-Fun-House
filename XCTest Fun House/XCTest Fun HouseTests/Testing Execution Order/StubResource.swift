/// Let's see how we can test that the `Resource`s are activated and deactivated in the correct order.
///
/// First, we need to create a stub `Resource` implementation to capture calls to the `activate`
/// and `deactivate` methods. Two internally created `XCTestExpection`s are used to track
/// method invocations.

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - description: the expectation's description.
    ///   - activateExpectedToExecute: if the test expects the `activate` function to execute; default is `true`.
    ///   - deactivateExpectedToExecute: if the test expects the `deactivate` function to execute; default is `true`.
